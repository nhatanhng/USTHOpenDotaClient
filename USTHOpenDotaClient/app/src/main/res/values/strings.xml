    <string name="anti_mage_story"><![CDATA["The monks of Turstarkuri watched the rugged valleys
    below their mountainmonastery as wave after wave of invaders swept through the lower kingdoms.
    Ascetic and pragmatic,in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife,
    wrapped in meditation thatknew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God,
    crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord\'s
    poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a
    thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against
    Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault,and the few monks who
    bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to
    distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth
     survived—a pilgrimwho had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to
     the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were
     first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God\'s priesthood.With nothing
     but a few of Turstarkuri\'s prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety
     of other lands,swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God\   's magic users—but to put an end
     to magic altogether."]]></string>
